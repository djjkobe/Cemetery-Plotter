# USER STORIES

### "As a <role>, I want <goal/desire> so that <benefit>"

* As a user, I want to be able to search for names of those who are in the cemetary to find what plot they are located in.

* As a user, I want the plots to be organized in a gridded system (ex: G20, F52) in order to better locate plots.

* As a user, I want to be able to list all the vacant plots for when we need to find a location for a new burial.
